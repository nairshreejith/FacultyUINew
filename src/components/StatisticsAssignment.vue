            <h4><b>Describe statistics.</b></h4>

            <p>
              The term "statistics" refers to both the science and the practice of
              employing empirical data expressed in a quantitative form to advance human
              knowledge. Instead of a branch of mathematics, it typically considers a
              different mathematical science. Data collection, processing, and
              summarization in numerical form are all statistical analysis components.
            </p>

            <p>
              Statistics employs instruments for forecasting and prediction by using data
              and statistical models. The field is valid for several "academic subjects,"
              including finance, insurance, and economics.
            </p>

            <h4><b>Example: Analyzing Customer Satisfaction for a Retail Store</b></h4>

            <p>
              <b>Problem Statement:</b> The retail store wants to analyze customer
              satisfaction based on their shopping experience. The data will help the
              store to identify the areas of improvement and make changes to increase
              customer satisfaction.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Data Collection:</b> A survey was conducted with 100 customers visiting
              the store in the past month. The survey consisted of 10 questions related to
              various aspects of their shopping experience, such as the store layout,
              product availability, customer service, and overall satisfaction. The data
              was collected on a Likert scale where the customers rated their responses on
              a scale of 1 to 5, with one being strongly disagreed and five strongly
              agreed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Data Analysis:</b> To analyze the data, the mean score was calculated for
              each question and overall satisfaction and then compared the results with
              the store's benchmark score to identify areas of improvement.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Results:</b> The results showed that the customers were most satisfied
              with the store's product availability and customer service but had mixed
              opinions about the store layout. The overall satisfaction means the score
              was 3.8, slightly below the benchmark score of 4.0.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Summary:</b> The survey results indicated that the store needs to improve
              its layout to enhance customer satisfaction. The store can make changes to
              the design, such as adding more signage and rearranging the products to make
              it easier for customers to find what they are looking for. Based on the
              results, the store can also maintain a high level of customer service and
              product availability to satisfy their customers.
            </p>

            <h4><b>Statistical Types</b></h4>

            <p>
              <b>Descriptive Statistics:</b> Descriptive statistics involves summarizing
              and organizing data to depict the data's characteristics and patterns. This
              type of statistics uses measures of central tendencies, such as mean,
              median, and mode, and actions of variability, such as range and standard
              deviation. Descriptive statistics can also include graphs and charts to
              represent the data visually.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Inferential Statistics:</b> Inferential statistics involves
              generalizations about a population based on a sample of data. This statistic
              uses statistical models and tests to determine the people from a selection.
              Inferential statistics include hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and
              ANOVA. These statistical methods help researchers make predictions and draw
              conclusions about a population based on a sample of data.
            </p>

            <p>
              Both descriptive and inferential statistics are essential in data analysis
              and decision-making. Descriptive statistics give a comprehensive overview of
              the data, while inferential statistics allow researchers to draw conclusions
              and make predictions about a larger population based on a sample of data.
            </p>
