            <h4>What is Strategic Management?</h4>

            <p>
              Strategic Management is the process of planning, implementing, and
              evaluating decisions made by an organization's top executives and managers
              to ensure the long-term success of the organization. It involves analyzing
              the organization's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats to
              determine its overall direction and making decisions on allocating its
              resources to pursue its goals. Strategic management also involves monitoring
              and adjusting the organization's strategy to respond to a changing business
              environment. The ultimate purpose of strategic management is to create and
              sustain competitive advantage, increase organizational value, and achieve
              long-term success.

            <p>
              Strategic management ensures an organization's long-term success by creating
              and sustaining a competitive advantage. It involves analyzing the
              organization's internal and external environment, setting goals and
              objectives, and making decisions on allocating resources to pursue these
              objectives.
            </p>

            <h4>Creating and Developing Strategies:</h4>

            <p>
              Creating and developing strategies is a critical aspect of strategic
              management. It involves the identification of a clear vision, mission, and
              set of long-term goals for the organization, as well as formulating a plan
              to achieve these objectives. This process involves analyzing the
              organization's internal and external environment to determine its strengths,
              weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis) and considering
              market trends and customer needs. Based on this analysis, strategic options
              are developed and evaluated to determine the best course of action. The
              chosen strategy is then translated into specific, actionable plans and
              implemented across the organization to drive performance and achieve the
              organization's goals.
