            <p><b>How does Cloud Computing Work?</b></p>
            <p>
              Thanks to the computer science subject known as "cloud computing," people
              can access the designated resources on their systems through the internet at
              any time and from any location.
            </p>
            <p>
              With cloud computing, a business can store and access its data from a remote
              database over the internet rather than having the records gathered on local
              storage. If the data is stored on the cloud, the user can access it from
              anywhere without having to be present at a certain location.
            </p>
