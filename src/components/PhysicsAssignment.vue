            <h4>What is Physics?</h4>

            <p>
              <b>Physics</b> is the study of matter and energy and the interactions
              between them. It seeks to understand the underlying principles that govern
              the universe's behavior, from the smallest subatomic particles to the most
              significant structures in the cosmos.
            </p>

            <p>
              This natural science draws on mathematics and experiments to develop
              theories and models that describe the physical world. Some critical areas of
              inquiry in physics include mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism,
              optics, and quantum mechanics.
            </p>

            <p>
              Physicists work to expand our understanding of the universe and to develop
              new technologies based on that knowledge, ranging from medical imaging
              devices to renewable energy systems.
            </p>
