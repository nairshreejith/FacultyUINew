            <h4>What exactly is R programming?</h4>

            <p>
              <b>R</b> is a widely used open-source language created for statistical
              computing. To do statistical computing and graphics, it builds a statistical
              environment. Data miners and statisticians use the
              <b>R programming language</b> to examine data and create statistical tools.
            </p>

            <p>
              In the last several years, there has been a surge in need for <b>R</b> due
              to polling, literature database research, and surveying. Similar to the S
              language, <b>R</b> is a part of the GNU project, and Bell Laboratories,
              formerly Lucent Technologies, built the language's environment. R can be
              compared to how S was carried out.
            </p>

            <p>
              The source code for this programming language was written in C, FORTRAN, and
              R because it is a GNU project, and you can download the <b>R</b> program
              under the General Public License. Although there are many different
              graphical user interfaces available in this language, this makes the best
              use of the command-line interface.
            </p>

            <h4>How using R will benefit you:</h4>

            <ul>
              <li>
                Clinical trials will make use of the <b>R programming language</b>,
                Bootstrap, and Bayesian.
              </li>
              <li>It is utilized in logistic regression, mapping, and data mining.</li>
              <li>
                R language code is used for microarray analysis, modeling, and
                visualization.
              </li>
              <li>Use the RGUI.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The following characteristics of <b>R</b> make it a crucial component of
              your programming curriculum:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                To perform virtual statistical computations, this is a valuable tool. In
                addition to delivering error-free work, it also saves a significant amount
                of time and effort.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>R</b> is effective at handling data and provides a lot of storage.
              </li>
              <li>
                The interpretive language is R. A compiler is not required to generate a
                program from the code.
              </li>
              <li>
                A type of vector-based language is R. Thanks to this; you can use just one
                command to perform numerous intricate calculations and actions.
              </li>
              <li>
                Given that they feature a graphical user interface, you may use them to
                run on various operating systems, including UNIX, Windows, and Macros.
              </li>
              <li>This language supports data frames, matrices, lists, and arrays.</li>
              <li>
                C++, Java, .Net, FORTRAN, and other programming languages are supported.
