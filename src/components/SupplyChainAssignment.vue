            <h4>Supply Chain Management:</h4>

            <p>
              Supply chain management is coordinating and managing activities involved in
              producing and delivering goods and services from suppliers to customers.
            </p>

            <p>
              It is a critical aspect of modern business operations, as it affects not
              only the organization's ability to meet customer demands but also its
              competitiveness and profitability.
            </p>

            <h4>Why is Supply Chain Management Important?</h4>

            <p>
              Supply chain management is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it helps
              organizations to optimize their operations by reducing costs, improving
              efficiency, and enhancing quality.
            </p>

            <p>
              Secondly, it can help organizations to respond quickly and effectively to
              changes in customer demand, market conditions, and technology. Finally,
              effective supply chain management can help organizations to build strong
              relationships with suppliers, customers, and other stakeholders, enabling
              them to meet their needs better and achieve their objectives.
