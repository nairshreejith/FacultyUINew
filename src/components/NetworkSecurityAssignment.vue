            <h4>What Exactly Is A Computer Network?</h4>

            <p>
              The main goal of a computer network or data network is to join systems in a
              single network so that they may exchange data and resources. The global
              network to which billions of computers are connected is known as the
              internet. Coding is used to deliver the information, or the computing
              language is used to support it.
            </p>

            <p>
              The importance of computer networking should be understood by everyone
              living in the digital age. Users will be able to remotely access the
              databases and programmes thanks to computer networking. Information may be
              found in the organisation itself or in open sources.
            </p>

            <p>
              You can connect to individuals worldwide while seated at home, utilising a
              system, by employing the foundations of computer networking. Rapid
              communication is made possible via computer networks. connected With the
              assistance of data connections, the networked connecting devices will
              exchange information with one another.

            <p>
              The Cisco Packet Tracer programme enables users to simulate the architecture
              of Cisco switches and routers by using a simulated command-line interface.
              The user interface is drag-and-drop, allowing users to integrate or subtract
              virtual network tools as they see fit.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cisco Packet Tracer is primarily targeted towards Certified Cisco Network
              Associate (CCNA) Academy students as an educational tool to help them become
              familiar with the fundamental CCNA concepts.
            </p>
