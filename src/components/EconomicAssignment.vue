            <h4>Define Economics.</h4>
            <p>
              Adam Smith, a Scottish philosopher, coined the term "economics" to study the
              wealth of nations. As a result, political economics became a branch of
              economics. It was an analysis of economics from a macro perspective. Alfred
              Marshall defined the field as "the study of people in everyday business,"
              and scholars began researching it at a micro level.
            </p>

            <p>
              The term "economics" comes from the Greek words "oikonomomia," meaning
              "household management. One must know all its concepts to understand the
              subject better and apply it to real-world issues. The two main subfields of
              economics are microeconomics and macroeconomics.
            </p>

            <b>1 Macroeconomics</b>

            <p>
              This area of economics focuses on the general economy of the neighbourhood,
              society, or even a whole country. It can be about what determines a
              country's wealth or the causes of widespread repetition.
            </p>
            <p>
              Macroeconomics examines the economy as a whole, including the Gross National
              Product (GNP), and how changes in unemployment, national wages, the pace of
              development, and pricing and value levels affect it.
            </p>
            <b>2 Microeconomics </b>
            <p>
              This area of economics focuses on how people behave as consumers, such as
              how households spend their money or how individuals manage their income. In
              particular, microeconomics advises taking government-imposed taxes and
              regulations into account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Supply, demand, and other forces determine the range of values in the
              economy's prices. Consider how, as a specific association, it may increase
              production and limit its reach to reduce costs and advance in its sector.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recognize that a large part of contemporary economics is linked to
              mathematics, particularly game theory if you need clarification about the
              strong connections between diverse domains of study. A group of skilled
              economists named NN IT Soft has demonstrated outstanding leadership
              in economic analysis through their knowledge and skill.

            <p>
              Students feel restricted by the academic demands of challenging disciplines
              like economics, which are only possible with the necessary supervision from
              a tutor. Due to the time commitment required for all academic disciplines
              and extracurricular activities, students can only concentrate on one
              subject, such as economics.
            </p>

            </h4>
            <b>Macro- and microeconomics: </b>
            <p>
              Microeconomics examines the behavior and decisions of individual consumers
              and firms. Economic performance and structure are studied in macroeconomics.
            </p>
            <b>Econometrics and International Economics: </b>
            <p>
              Econometrics is the branch of economics that uses statistical and
              mathematical methods to analyze economic data and test hypotheses about
              financial relationships. It uses various techniques such as regression, time
              series, and panel data analysis to establish cause-and-effect relationships
              and predict future economic events.
            </p>
            <p>
              International Economics is the branch of economics that studies the economic
              interactions among countries and how these interactions are affected by
              trade, investment, and financial flows. It examines the causes and effects
              of trade policies, exchange rate movements, and other economic variables
              that affect international trade and investment.
            </p>
            <b>Community Economics:</b>
            <p>
              Community economics is an interdisciplinary field focusing on local
              communities and regions' economic conditions and activities. It can use
              economic development to improve the well-being of people in these areas and
              how local resources can create sustainable and resilient communities.
              Community economics approaches include community-based participatory
              research, community-based economic development, and local economic
              governance. This field of economics also looks into how public policies and
              private sector activities can affect communities and how communities can
              respond to these influences.
            </p>
            <b>Industrial Economics:</b>
            <p>
              Industrial economics is a branch of economics that studies the behavior and
              structure of firms and industries. It examines how firms make decisions
              about production, pricing, and investment and how these decisions are
              affected by market conditions and government policies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Industrial economics examines the market structure, firm behavior,
              government's role, technological impact, and competition within an industry.
            </p>
            <b>Economics and politics:</b>
            <p>
              Economics and politics are related, as economic policy is often a central
              issue in political debates and decision-making. Economic policies such as
              taxation, government spending, and regulation impact economic activity. In
              contrast, political decisions such as trade agreements and international
              relations can affect the flow of goods and capital across borders.
            </p>
            <b>Economics of Health and Development: </b>
            <p>
              The economics of health and development is a subfield that examines the
              economic aspects of health and development issues, focusing on how economic
              policies and interventions can improve health outcomes and promote growth.
              It looks at the link between health and economic growth, the costs and
              benefits of different health interventions, health systems financing, and
              health's impact on poverty and inequality. Health economics also examines
              the role of government in providing health services and the impact of the
              private sector on health care.
