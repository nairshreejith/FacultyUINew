            <h4>JavaScript Programming</h4>

            <p>
              <b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language primarily used to create
              interactive and dynamic websites. It is a client-side scripting language,
              meaning the code is executed by the user's web browser rather than on a
              server. JavaScript enables the creation of things like form validation,
              interactive maps, and dynamic content updates, making web pages more
              responsive and user-friendly. It can also be used to create web and mobile
              apps and combined with other technologies, such as HTML and CSS, to create
              complex web applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>JavaScript</b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language that can
              create dynamic, interactive web pages and applications. It is an
              object-oriented language, meaning it functions by manipulating objects
              within a hierarchy or "tree." JavaScript has a wide range of features,
              including:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Data types:</b> JavaScript supports primitive data types such as
                numbers, strings, booleans, and symbols in addition to objects, arrays,
                and functions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Control flow:</b> JavaScript supports conditional statements, loops,
                and functions to control the flow of a program.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Event handling:</b> JavaScript can handle events, such as user input
                and page load events, to make a webpage more interactive.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>DOM manipulation:</b> JavaScript can interact with a webpage's Document
                Object Model (DOM). It allows web developers to manipulate elements of a
                web page, such as changing element attributes, creating new features, and
                responding to user input.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Libraries and frameworks:</b> JavaScript has an extensive library of
                frameworks and libraries that can use for various tasks, such as React for
                building user interfaces and Node.js for developing servers.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Why Is It Important to Learn JavaScript?</h4>

            <p>
              <b>JavaScript</b> is an important programming language to learn for several
              reasons.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Popularity:</b> JavaScript is one of the most popular programming
                languages today, with many applications in web development, mobile app
                development, and server-side programming.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Web Development:</b> JavaScript is a crucial language for creating
                interactive and dynamic websites. It can use to create things like image
                sliders, form validation, and interactive maps. JavaScript frameworks such
                as React, AngularJS, and Vue.js make it easier to build complex web
                applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Browser Compatibility:</b> JavaScript is supported by all major web
                browsers, making it an essential tool for creating
                cross-browser-compatible web applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Server-side Programming:</b> Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on
                Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allows JavaScript to be used on the server
                side for creating scalable and high-performance applications.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Versatility:</b> JavaScript can use in various domains like Gaming,
                Virtual Reality, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and more.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Topics in JS</h4>

            <p>
              Let's review some critical <b>JavaScript</b> issues where students struggle
              most with their assignments or homework.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>A JS function</b> is a set of reusable code that eliminates the need
                for ongoing code development.
              </li>
              <li>
                When a user or browser modifies a page, JavaScript interacts with HTML by
                handling the following events. An "event" occurs when a page loads. A
                user's action triggers an event every time he or she clicks a button.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your server delivers data as a cookie to the visitor's browser, which is
                stored as a visible text file on the visitor's hard drive.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript enables three essential types of dialogue boxes to raise an
                alert, request confirmation of any input, or obtain a specific type of
                input from users.
              </li>
            </ul>
