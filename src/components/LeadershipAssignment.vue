                transition from its current condition to its desired future to achieve
                more successful results. Every organization goes through this process, and

                creates plans and tactics to ensure that workers adhere to their daily
                objectives and other tasks. Participation from the team, prompt
                communication, attentive listening, etc., are all parts of communication.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Execution leadership:</b> It entails using leadership abilities and a
                strategic mentality to carry out a task, perform a function, execute, or
                begin a project. The leader can implement a specific feature so that the

                <b>Performance of a team:</b> Team performance is a result of leadership
                management and is improved by it. Some ways to boost the team's
                performance include encouraging employee appreciation, articulating and
                sharing the project's goal, committing to ongoing education, and
                delegating and empowering other staff members.
              </li>
              <li>

                understand the team's strengths and limitations, and equipping them with
                knowledge of their value to the business and dedication to the
                organization.

                leaders who practice ethical leadership live up to their values and norms
                in their day-to-day operations. The organization faces some dangers, and
                moral leadership is helpful in properly managing those risks.
              </li>

                must develop to meet the needs and wishes of the followers of that leader.
                The role of the leader is to engage, inspire, and motivate investors,
                partners, and staff.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Building a team:</b> Building a team is a leader's primary
                responsibility since it establishes a connection between followers and
                leaders. Employees with various mindsets and dispositions are grouped for
                a project or the firm's objectives, and the leader must enable
                frictionless cooperation between them.
