            <h4>What is the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h4>

            <p>
              The term "Internet of Things" refers to a collection of physical objects, or
              "things," that have sensors, software, and other technological components
              installed to interact and exchange data with other equipment and systems
              online (IoT).
            </p>

            <p>
              Basic household goods and cutting-edge industrial equipment are included in
              this category. Analysts predict that by 2020, there will be 10 billion
              connected IoT devices, and by 2025, there will be 22 billion. Currently,
              there are around 7 billion connected IoT devices.
            </p>

            <h4>How significant is the Internet of Things (IoT)?</h4>

            <p>
              Over the past few years, IoT has grown to become one of the most important
              21st-century technologies. Thanks to integrated devices' capacity to connect
              everyday products to the internet, such as kitchen appliances, autos,
              thermostats, and baby monitors, continuous communication between people,
              processes, and things are now possible.
            </p>

            <p>
              Physical things can share and gather data with little help from humans
              thanks to low-cost computers, the cloud, big data, analytics, and mobile
              technologies. Digital systems are capable of capturing, observing, and
              modifying every interaction between connected objects in today's
              hyper-connected environment.
            </p>

            <h4>Cloud computing and IoT</h4>

            <p>
              The Internet of Thing's success can be attributed to cloud computing. Users
              can complete computing activities using services made available through the
              Internet thanks to cloud computing. The Internet of Things and cloud
              computing are now interconnected thanks to the usage of both technologies
              together, acting as a sort of accelerator. These are genuine future
              technologies that will have numerous advantages.
            </p>

            <p>
              The challenge of storing, analysing, and accessing massive volumes of data
              has emerged as a result of the quick development of technology. Cloud
              technology and Internet of Things technology can be used collaboratively to
              create great innovations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Sensor data streams can be combined with new monitoring services for
              advanced processing. For example, sensor data can be transferred to the
              cloud and retained for use in intelligent monitoring and activation by other
              devices in the future. The objective is to turn data into insights, which
              will then motivate practical and profitable action.
            </p>

            <h4>IoT Cloud Functions and Benefits:</h4>

            <p>The benefits of integrating these services are numerous.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>IoT Numerous connectivity choices:</b> Cloud computing offers extensive
                network access, indicating extensive network access. Many people access
                cloud computing resources through mobile, tablet, and laptop devices.
                Users find this convenient, but it raises the issue of a requirement for
                network access points.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>IoT cloud computing on demand:</b> Cloud computing is available to
                developers on demand. It's an online service that can be accessed without
                any assistance or special authorization. Users can scale the service based
                on their requests and needs.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>IoT Resource sharing:</b> Resource sharing is implied by cloud
                computing. It encourages more cooperation and forges strong bonds among
                users. Security issues arise when the use of automation and IoT devices
                increases. Businesses can use trustworthy authentication and encryption
                processes thanks to cloud solutions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>IoT Practicality:</b> IoT cloud computing is practical since you
                receive exactly what you paid for from the provider. This indicates that
                fees change according to use because the provider tracks your usage
                patterns.
              </li>
            </ul>
