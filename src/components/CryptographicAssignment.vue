            <h4>What is Cryptography?</h4>

            <p>
              <b>Cryptography</b> uses mathematical algorithms to encrypt and decrypt
              information to ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity. It
              is used to secure communication and protect sensitive information from
              unauthorized access. Cryptography has a long history, dating back to ancient
              civilizations, where secret messages were often encoded using simple
              techniques like substitution cyphers.
            </p>

            <p>
              With the advancement of technology and the increasing use of digital
              communication, cryptography has become increasingly complex and
              sophisticated. Cryptography is used in various areas, such as computer
              security, network security, and military communication. Some techniques,
              like digital signatures and certificates, are used to ensure the
              authenticity and integrity of electronic transactions. It has become an
              essential tool in today's digital age, providing a secure means of
              communication and protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access.
            </p>

            <h4>Goals for Using Cryptography</h4>

            <p>
              <b>Confidentiality:</b> Cryptography ensures the confidentiality of
              information by encoding it so that only authorized parties can access it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Data protection:</b> It protects sensitive information such as personal
              data, financial information, and intellectual property from unauthorized
              access and theft.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Authentication:</b> Cryptography provides a way to verify the identity of
              individuals and devices, ensuring that communication and transactions are
              secure.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Integrity:</b> The integrity of information, preventing unauthorized
              changes and ensuring that data is not tampered with during transmission.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Non-repudiation:</b> It provides proof of the authenticity of a message,
              transaction, or digital signature, making it difficult for someone to deny
              having sent or received the information.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Privacy:</b> Protect privacy by enabling secure communication and
              preventing unauthorized access to personal information.
            </p>

            <h4>Why do students need help with their cryptography homework?</h4>

            <p>
              <b>Lack of Complete Coding Knowledge:</b> Lack of complete coding knowledge
              is one of the main reasons why some students seek coding assignment help.
              When students need a thorough understanding of the concepts, techniques, and
              strategies involved in coding, they may need help to complete their
              assignments independently and effectively.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Lack of Focus:</b> Lack of focus to complete an assignment refers to an
              individual's inability to concentrate on the task at hand and may need help
              to finish it efficiently and effectively. It can also lead to frustration,
              decreased productivity and confidence, and ultimately, negatively impact the
              outcome of the assignment.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Confusing Codes:</b> If an individual is struggling with confusing codes
              in their coding assignment, they may benefit from seeking help. A
              professional tutor or mentor can provide guidance and support to help the
              student understand the code better and offer strategies for troubleshooting
              and making changes to the code.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Having Problems Managing Time:</b> Having problems managing time to
              complete an assignment is when individuals need help to allocate their time
              effectively and efficiently to finish the task on time. It can be caused by
              various factors, including procrastination, poor time management skills, and
              too many distractions. Students may seek assignment help in this situation
              also.
